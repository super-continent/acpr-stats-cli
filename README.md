# acpr-stats-cli
Generate a CSV of your Guilty Gear Accent Core +R replay winrates. Each cell contains the result of `wins / wins + losses` with each character (win percentages, shifted down by 2 decimal points.)

# How to use
Download the program and drag your ACPR `REPLAYS` folder onto the executable. This folder should be contained within your `Documents/ARC SYSTEM WORKS/GGXXACPR` folder. It should output a CSV file.
Run it in a CLI if you need to see more options.
